¡Buenos días! - or "good morning" for those who don't speak Spanish. My name is Noel (or Kvasigard, pronounced as /kva-si-gaard/).

I was born in the early 2000s near Barcelona, Spain, and this is my blog. Here, I’ll talk about everything that piques my interest, from tech to my most personal opinions.

I am a tech enthusiast, a wannabe programmer, and a cybersecurity lover. On this blog, you’ll find what I’m learning through my personal projects, which usually revolve around malware, reverse engineering, and Windows.

I’m always up for a chat or a deep dive into "cyber", so if you want to reach out, you can contact me via email (noelcg@pm.me) or through my social media (Twitter, GitHub, and LinkedIn).

Happy Hacking!
