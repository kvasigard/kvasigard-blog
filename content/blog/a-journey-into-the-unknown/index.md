_"The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence." - Albert Einstein_

If there is one inherently true thing, it’s that everything has a beginning. More often than not, that origin is curiosity, and this case is no exception; that is where this space is born. My intent for this blog is for it to be my own adventure log: a place to explore the unknown and turn my doubts into hypotheses that I will try to prove, or debunk, as I go.

Over the past few years, I’ve gathered insights from books and projects that, until now, remained adrift. My goal is to materialize all that chaos in this small logbook. I want to synthesize what I learn by making mistakes, breaking things, and fixing them again. This is a record of my failures; because those errors are, in reality, what build my understanding. By making this process public, I hope that my stumbles and successes may be of use to you as well.

My only intention is to convey my passion for what I do through my experiments, sharing the trail of my journey with whoever wishes to follow it. Welcome to my blog.
